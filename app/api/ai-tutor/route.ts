Let's strengthen your number foundations:
Integers - Understanding positive/negative numbers (like temperatures: +30°C hot, -5°C cold)
Fractions - Parts of a whole (like sharing 3/4 of a pizza among friends)
Simple Equations - Finding missing numbers (if 2 + ? = 7, then ? = 5)
Basic Geometry - Shapes and angles you see around you

Foundation tip: Master number sense first! Can you count backwards from 20? Do you know which is bigger: 3/4 or 2/3?
